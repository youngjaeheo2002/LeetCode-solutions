class Solution:
    def checkValidString(self, s: str) -> bool:
        leftMin,leftMax = 0,0

        for c in s:
            if c == '(':
                leftMin += 1
                leftMax += 1
            elif c == ')':
                leftMin -=1
                leftMax -=1
            
            else:
                leftMin -=1
                leftMax +=1

            if leftMax < 0:
                return False

            if leftMin <0:
                leftMin =0
        return leftMin ==0

the idae:
counting the balance between left and right
if during iteration, you find leftmax <0 then you know that there are more rights than lefts or a right comes before a left
which is invalid
if leftmin < 0, you know that instead of counting * as ) you should either coutn it as space or (
so reset it to 0

then return leftMin ==0
